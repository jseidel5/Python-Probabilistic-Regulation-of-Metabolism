# Python Implementation of Probabilistic Regulation of Metabolism (PROM)

This algorithm is able to integrate gene regulatory and metabolic networks by using conditional probabilities to represent the constraints imposed by regulation. PROM can predict an organism's phenotype after the knockout of a regulator.

This Python Implementation is based on the publication:
based on Chandrasekaran et al 2010

Python Implementation produces results similar to the original Matlab Implementation of the PROM algorithm.
